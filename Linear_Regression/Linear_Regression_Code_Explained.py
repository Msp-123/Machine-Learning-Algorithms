1. Importing Libraries:
import numpy as np

2. Defining the LinearRegression Class:
class LinearRegression:

3. Constructor (__init__ Method):
def __init__(self, lr=0.001, n_iters=1000):
    self.lr = lr
    self.n_iters = n_iters
    self.weights = None
    self.bias = None

The __init__ method initializes the class instance. It takes two optional arguments: 
lr (learning rate) and n_iters (number of iterations). It also initializes the weights and bias attributes as None.

4. Fit Method:
def fit(self, X, y):
    n_samples, n_features = X.shape
    self.weights = np.zeros(n_features)
  
    for _ in(self.n_iters):
        y_pred = np.dot(X, self.weights) + self.bias
        
        dw = (1 / n_samples) * np.dot(X.T, (y_pred - y))
        db = (1 / n_samples) * np.sum(y_pred - y)
        
        self.weights = self.weights - (self.lr*dw)
        self.bias = self.bias - (self.lr * db)

The fit method performs the training of the Linear Regression model. It takes two arguments: X (input features) and y (target values).

- n_samples and n_features store the number of samples and features in the input data.
- The weights are initialized as an array of zeros with a length equal to the number of features.
- The for loop iterates for the specified number of iterations (n_iters).
- Predictions y_pred are calculated using the current weights and bias.
- dw represents the gradient of the weights, and db represents the gradient of the bias.
- The weights and bias are updated using the gradients and the learning rate.

5. Predict Method:
def predict(self, X):
    y_pred = np.dot(X, self.weights) + self.bias
    return y_pred
The predict method takes input features X and calculates predictions y_pred using the trained weights and bias.

In summary, this code defines a LinearRegression class with methods to initialize the model, fit it to data, and make predictions. 
However, there's a small error in the code: the for loop in the fit method should be written 
as for _ in range(self.n_iters): instead of for _ in(self.n_iters):.
